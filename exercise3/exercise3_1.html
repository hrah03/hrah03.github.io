        <h1> A Handmade Web</h1>
        <p class="papayasen"> The term 'handmade' usually refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather than machines.<br> The result may be homelyüó° ‚Äî as in a child's clay ashtray ‚Äî or exquisite‚öîÔ∏è ‚Äî as in a pair of bespoke brogues.
        </p>
        <p class="dropcap"><b>I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity.</b>
        </p>
        <p>Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic web and before the corporate web. ‚ÄòHandmade‚Äô is by no means the only or best term to define the web of this period.
        </p>
        <p>In her essay, <a href="http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/">A Vernacular Web</a> (2005), Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as: bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.
        </p>
        <p>For more information on Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied's excellent research on the amateur web, see: <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/1tb/about">One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age: Digging through the Geocities Torrent</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="dropcap"><b>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.</b>
        </p>
        <p>I made my first web-based work in 1995. The impetus for <a href="http://luckysoap.com/butterflies/parasite.html">Fishes & Flying Things</a> came from the material practices of fine art and book-making. The text evolved from an installation art exhibition I had on at the time. From this text, I created a small book-work which was meant to tell a circular story but when people got to the end they stopped reading because that‚Äôs the way books work. In the web version, the last page linked to the first; the story circled round and round. Of the installation, no physical evidence remains. Of the book-work, only one copy. The QuarkExpress file is stored on a 44 MB SyQuest cartridge which I still own, but the contents of which I can no longer access. The handmade website, on the other hand, is still online and it still works.
        </p>
        <p>The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic relationship. This is evident in the early output of the <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/index.asp">trAce Online Writing Centre</a> founded at Nottingham Trent University in 1995. Over the next decade trAce evolved into one of the most influential online writing communities in the world. trAce‚Äôs first output was a <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/writersforthefuture/1995/">word-processed photocopied booklet</a> which contained links to websites distributing journals and zines. Fittingly, trAce‚Äôs last output was also a print booklet, in which it is stated:
        </p>
        <p>The trAce community embraced both camps, and some early chatlogs contain lively discussions about the use of mixed media in writing‚Ä¶ The creative hypertexts and hypermedia in the trAce Archive can easily be compared to the multifarious pages of an artist‚Äôs book. (PDF <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/traces/traces.pdf">trAces: A Commemoration of Ten Years of Artistic Innovation at trAce</a>, page 14)
        </p>
        <p>One of the many interesting things about the <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/index.asp">online archive</a> of the trAce Online Writing Centre is how much it reflects the context of the creation and dissemination of its contents. Whereas archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere ‚Äî manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs developed in a darkroom ‚Äî the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium within which they were created. That said, the frames through which we view them continue to change.
        </p>
        <p>In "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" (2011) Wolfgang Ernst observes: <i>If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play broadcast channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object anymore but actively generates sensual and informational presence.</i> Similarly, when viewing old web pages in modern browsers we are confronted with a temporal paradox. Layer upon layer of <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/cyberfest/index.htm">dated web-design aesthetics</a> overlap and peel like wallpaper, revealing earlier versions beneath. Pages optimised for lower resolutions now take <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/frame5/">less than a third of the screen</a>. Ghosts of browsers past mingle with occasional page errors, dead links, and missing images. Sound files play automatically. Warnings abound, issued from earlier eras, addressed to readers who are not us.
        </p>
        <p>For example, M.D. Coverley‚Äôs <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/frame5/coverley/index.html">The Personalization of Complexity</a> (2001) <i>explores the ways in which each of our personal computers have become idiosyncratic, individualized entities, only sometimes manageable by the owners.</i> Fittingly, the piece itself warns that it is viewable only on Level 4 and 5 Microsoft Internet Explorer and Level 4 Netscape. Netscape 6 will not support many of the features in this essay.
        </p>
        <p>These are not artifacts of a dead web but rather, signposts on a map of a living web pointing to a web as it once was, a web in progress, a web in the making.
